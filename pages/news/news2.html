    <h1>Flymount Generation-4</h1>
    <cite>by Amy Carter - Editor</cite> <cite>9th june 2017</cite>
    <p>Although aimed at the new generation of waterproof / shockproof cameras like the Pentax W90, the Flymount will hold any camera that has a standard tripod mounting point, including lightweight DSLRs.</p>

    <h1>Flymount Generation-4</h1>
    <cite>by Amy Carter - Editor</cite> <cite>9th june 2017</cite>
    <p> Flymount, the original windsurfing camera mounts, are upgrading to something even better and Flymount are giving you the opportunity to grab a Generation-4 at a bargain price, whilst also helping the company progress yet further. 
      “We started making camera mounts for windsurf rigs in 2006.</p>
    <p>“Our mounts had to be compact, light and tough enough to withstand the forces exerted on action sports equipment. They also had to work with a wide variety of cameras. These qualities have made our mounts the perfect solution for mounting cameras in awkward situations.</p>

    <h1>Flymount Generation-4</h1>
    <cite>by Amy Carter - Editor</cite> <cite>9th june 2017</cite>
    <p>“As always, Flymount Originals continue to work with virtually any camera on the market, from dedicated action cameras to DSLRs.
      “We spend a lot of time trying to break these mounts, and looking for any area that can be improved. The Generation-3 Flymount Original is an incredible mount, but we still felt that there were a few things we could do to make it even better.</p>
    <p>“On this new version, we’ve beefed up the area around the jaw hinge considerably. To the point where it’s now virtually unbreakable.
      “We’ve swapped one of the metal components for a new nylon part. This has shaved 31g off the overall weight of the product, and also handles grit and sand more effectively than the previous metal part.</p>

    <h1>Freewaves 2017</h1>
    <p>Well last year we got the Stubby wave range, this year we get the Stubby Freewave range!  And a lot of sense it makes too!  We haven’t had a chance to try one yet, but with the early planing and ease of sailing qualities that this shape has brought to the wave range, it’s surely got to be a perfect match to a Freewave design?  As soon as we get a chance to try one, we will let you know!  The Freewave Stubby will also be offered in Fanatic very exclusive TXTR construction as well as in Team Edition.</p>
    <p>If you’re still a bit nervous about Stubby’s then you will be reassured to hear that Fanatic have retained their highly regarded regular shaped Freewave range as well.  It will definitely be interesting to see how the new Stubby shape stacks up against this.  If I was a betting man, I would go with the Stubby!</p>

    <h1>Waveboards</h1>
    <p>Fanatic continue with their 3 ranges for 2017; Quad, Triwave and Stubby.  Nip over to Boardseeker to read how these boards stack up against each other.  Essentially, all three ranges get new paint jobs.  The Quad gets new fins, the Triwave is largely unchanged and the Stubby gets a 99 litre big brother as well as new fins.</p>
    <p>If you haven’t tried a Stubby yet, you really should.  The shape might look awkward, but on the water, they are anything but.  They are super fun, very easy to sail (easier than a regular wave board thanks to the wider tail) and really make the most of poorer conditions.
      For more info check the Fanatic website where they also have 3D animations of all the new models!</p>
